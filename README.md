# Simple Linear Regression Project
This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis performed using Python. The project aims to predict salaries based on years of experience using the given dataset.

Project Files
simple_linear_regression.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the implementation of the simple linear regression model.
Extended_Salary_Data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis. It contains information on years of experience and corresponding salaries.
Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Implementation of a simple linear regression model using Python libraries.
Visualization of the regression line and data points.
Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for writing and executing code.
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
